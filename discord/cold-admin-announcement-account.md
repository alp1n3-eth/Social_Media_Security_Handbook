# Cold Admin / Announcement Account

## Concept

Jon\_HQ created the "Cold Server Owner Account" guide and has updated it to Version v.3. Refer to the link at the bottom for the original source image.

The idea behind a "cold server owner account" is that it is impossible to phish. It's impossible to phish, because it isn't used regularly, and is only utilized when specific actions are needed, and those actions are only performed on a known-good device. These accounts will not interact with anyone (via DMs or otherwise) in the day-to-day actions of the server.&#x20;



## Setup

{% hint style="warning" %}
No VPNs should be used during this process.
{% endhint %}

1. Identify who will be the server owner and who will need Administrator permissions.
2. Every member of the team will need an unused or old device. This can be a freshly wiped or new laptop/phone. It needs to essentially have a "clean" OS to fully remove the risk of lingering malware.
3. On this device, each team member will create a new Gmail account. Record the username and password on a piece of paper.
4. Create a brand new Discord account using the new Gmail account. Use a different password than the Gmail account. Record the username and password on a piece of paper.
5. In "User Settings" modify the following:

* [ ] Set a unique profile picture and "About Me" description in the "Profiles" section.
* [ ] Disable direct messages from server members in the "Privacy & Safety" section.
* [ ] Disable all options under the "Friend Requests" section.
* [ ] Add **mobile app based (Authy, Google Authenticator)** two-factor authentication under the "My Account" section.
  * [ ] Do not share the QR code.
  * [ ] Write down the backup codes on paper.
  * [ ] Ensure SMS backup authentication is disabled.
* [ ] If setting up the cold server owner account, link and verify a phone number that has **not been used for any other Discord account**.
* [ ] To ensure Discord does not flag the account as a bot and terminate it, create a new empty Discord server and post a few messages in it.
  * [ ] Join 2-3 public servers from the server browser in the sidebar and send 2-3 messages in each server.
  * [ ] Log in and out of the cold Discord account over the next 5 days.&#x20;
  * [ ] Imbue "life" into this account before joining the real project's server and gaining permissions.

## Usage

Use this cold administrator account in order to make changes such as adding bots, accessing bot dashboards, modifying the server, and more. If there is ever a server compromise or attack, utilize the cold admin account to neutralize the threat.
