# Account Creation & App Configuration

## Create Your Account

1. On a freshly wiped iPhone download the official Signal app from the app store. The app developer is listed as "Signal Messenger, LLC".
2. Do not allow Signal access to your contacts. Feel free to choose whether notifications are allowed.
3. Enter a phone number that your organization is going to use specifically for this Signal account. A phone number that is dedicated to this usage is preferred. If a previous account has existed, enter the PIN for that account and select "Register without Transferring", which will continue without transferring your account and messages.
4. Finish any other account configurations required. If a PIN is requested to be set, make sure it is at least 16 digits. Write this PIN down on a piece of paper and keep it in a safe. Have one other member of your organization do the same in order to have a backup.
